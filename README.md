# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is my first ever coding experience! I wanted to build a webpage that would allow me to easily find and read notes on different topics that I encounter during my coding bootcamp course. The webpage allows me to quickly access notes on different topics, and suggests which order is best to tackle the lengthy notes!

Despite this being a basic website, I learned so much about the different coding languages required to build web applications. Even though I found it confusing at times, I'm proud that I was able to produce something functional (I hope!). I was able to work on my developer mindset by perservering, not giving up and solving problems. I'm excited to keep going and learning more!

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. You can read notes about a certain topic, in this case HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. 

For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
